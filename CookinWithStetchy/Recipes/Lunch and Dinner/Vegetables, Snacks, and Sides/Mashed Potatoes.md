## Ingredients

- Potatoes*, diced (about an inch. Fastens cooking process)
- Ranch
- Shredded Cheese**
- Milk
- Sour Cream
- Green onion, (optional)
- Bacon/ Bacon bits, (optional)

NOTE: I prefer to use skin on red or gold potatoes, but peeled russets, or any potato, will do.
NOTE: Sharper cheeses, like Colby-Jack and Cheddar, work best.

##### Variations

- (Easy Duchess) Remove Ranch, cheese, green onion, bacon, toppings. Add pinch of nutmeg, bake.
- Don't mash potatoes all the way, Add Chicken Broth and cooked bacon to turn into Potato Soup.

### Seasonings 
#### Required	
- Salt
- Pepper
- Garlic Powder
#### Optional
- Anything you want, really.

## Instructions

1. Boil and cook potatoes. Strain and keep in the same pot.
2. As you mash the potatoes, add in a splash of milk, a few spoons of sour cream, a squirt of ranch, and your seasonings. Mash well.
3. Taste. If it is..
	1. Too Thick - add milk or ranch
	2. Too Thin - add cheese or sour cream
	3. Too Bland - add more salt/ seasoning or cheese
	4. Too Grainy - Mash more and add more sour cream
4. Add in any toppings such as Bacon or Green onion, and serve.
