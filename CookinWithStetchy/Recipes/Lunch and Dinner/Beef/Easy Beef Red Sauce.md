## Ingredients

- Beef, ground, 1 lb.
- Tomato pasta sauce, 1 jar, brand of your choice (I recommend Classico)
- Tomato, canned, crushed or diced
- Onion, diced, 1/2 to 1 depending on preference (optional)
- Celery, sliced, 2 stalks (optional)
- Mushroom, 1 lb fresh or 1 jar (optional)
- Pasta, dry or frozen, your choice
- Oil, olive preferred but any neutral oil will work

##### Seasonings 
Required	
- Italian Blend (Oregano, Parsley, Basil) (like $1 at walmart)
- Garlic Powder or fresh
###### Optional
- Sriracha or Red Pepper Flakes
- Tarragon (VERY SMALL AMOUNT)
- Tony Chachere's
- Parmesan Cheese (or any other cheese, really)

## Instructions

1. Get a pan that has walls high enough to make the sauce in (not a frying pan, a pot will work as well). Leave it on medium heat to get it warm before drizzling with a bit of oil.
2. Add in the beef and seasonings (reserve cheeses for last if using), breaking up the ground beef and stirring semi often. (if you are using fresh mushrooms, add them now.)
3. Cook the beef about halfway before adding the vegetables. Sautee until onions are translucent.
4. When everything is cooked and softened to your liking, drain the beef fat drippings if present before adding the tomato sauce. Add the can of crushed tomato, or if you are using diced tomato, strain it before adding. Mix well. Now is a good time to add more seasonings if you wish.
5. As you bring the sauce to a boil, prepare the pasta as directed on the package.
6. Let the sauce boil for 5-10 minutes, stirring to prevent burning.
7. Serve on top of pasta, and sprinkle cheese on before serving.
