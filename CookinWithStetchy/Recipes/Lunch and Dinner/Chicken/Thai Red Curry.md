## Instructions

1. Put the cut up chicken in a large Ziploc bag and set aside.
2. Get a bowl that fits all your spices and make a blend. Go by smell and a bit of taste. You will need a lot of this. Too much is better than not enough. You *can* add spices directly to the pot later, but making all of the seasoning you need now will save you a lot of headache, TRUST ME.
3. Add enough seasoning to coat the chicken in the Ziploc bag and rub the seasoning and some curry paste on thoroughly, massaging it into the chicken through the Ziploc bag.
4. Melt the butter in a large pot before adding the prepared chicken, do not move the chicken in the pan too much so that it gains texture. Flip the pieces halfway.
5. Once chicken is fully cooked, remove chicken and set aside, add the Coconut milk and a [[Terms and Vocabulary|splash]] of milk. Take off heat.
6. While whisking the milk, add your seasonings until the color, smell, and taste are right. Also add a few spoons of curry paste to your liking. Make sure the taste is correct.
7. Add all of your vegetables, and if the squash is not submerged, add milk as needed. Simmer until squash is [[Terms and Vocabulary|fork tender]]. Add the chicken back in.
8. Remove 1/4 cup of the sauce into a separate container and mix in a tablespoon of cornstarch. Mix it WELL. Add the mix back into the pot and remove from heat. Let cool for ten minutes.
9. If it is not thickened to your liking, add flour a tablespoon at a time, stirring well between tablespoons, until it is thickened to your liking. It is better to go through the trouble of repeating step 8, but at this point, you are tired and hungry. Be careful with flour, because it is more likely to affect the taste than cornstarch.
10. While your curry sauce is resting, prepare your rice as the package directs, but add the basil leaves when the rice is halfway cooked.
11. Serve over prepared rice, and squeeze a lime wedge on top, and maybe some more basil leaves. Enjoy! you just busted your ass making this.
