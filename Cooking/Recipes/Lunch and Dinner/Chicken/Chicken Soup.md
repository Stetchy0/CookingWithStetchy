NOTE: Dark meat is best, but any chicken will do. It can be frozen too, no need to thaw.
NOTE: Reserve some of the celery leaves. Do not mince, keep it as a stalk.

## Instructions

1. In a large pot, pour in all of your chicken broth, some seasonings, and your celery leaf sprig, and add chicken (if it is bone in, do not debone yet.) If the chicken is not completely submerged, add water. Boil, covered, until the chicken is completely cooked.
2. Remove chicken and prepare it however you like. This includes deboning, slicing, shredding, etc. Return it to the broth with all of your vegetables, do not forget your mushrooms, I forget to add them a lot.
3. Season [[Notes|TT]]. When all of the vegetables are softened, add in the two cans of cream soups, and cream cheese. Stir, chopping the cheese with your spoon so it incorporates quicker.
4. Add in your rice, pasta, noodles, or dumplings and let cook on low to medium heat until your starch is cooked, if using, or Bake your biscuits. Serve.
