## Ingredients

- Meatballs, Frozen, 32 oz
- Grape Jelly, 1 cup (trust)
- Barbeque Sauce, 1.5 cup
- [[Notes#Must-Have Pantry/ fridge items|Chile Garlic Sauce]], 2 tbsp

### Seasonings 
#### Required	
- Salt
- Pepper
#### Optional
- Garlic
- Onion powder
- Ginger
- Sriracha

## Instructions

1. Add everything into a slow cooker and stir until incorporated.
2. Cook on low for 3-5 hours, until the center of the meatball is hot. Time varies in this bracket depending on how large the meatballs are, look for smaller ones.
3. It's really that easy.

NOTE: I have no idea what this would go good with. Just eat it on its own or with crackers maybe? I'll update this next time I make it and figure it out.
