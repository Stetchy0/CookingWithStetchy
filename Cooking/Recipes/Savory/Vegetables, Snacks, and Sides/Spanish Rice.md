## Instructions

1. Drizzle oil in a saucepan or pot. Add rice, stir well to just coat the rice in oil and add more if needed. Brown over medium heat, this will take longer than you think. After stirring occasionally for 3  minutes, you need to start paying careful attention, stirring often, as to not burn the rice. The halfway mark is when you would add fresh garlic, if using. The rice will become not shiny and fragrant when it is ready. 
2. Add enough Broth/ water to cover the rice. (If using water, add in chicken bouillon to taste, ballpark 2 tbsp. or TT. Make sure to press the clumps as its mixed in so there aren't any spots with a shit ton of bouillon.) Sprinkle a layer of garlic powder over the top.
3. Add in the onion.
4. Add in tomato sauce until it is bright orange, not red. Make sure to stir as you do this so you don't over-tomato it.
5. Stir well and bring to a boil.
6. Turn off the heat, leaving the pot in the same spot, and cover. Leave it be. Check after 5 minutes to see if it needs more water, but try to leave it alone.
7. It should be ready after about ten minutes.
