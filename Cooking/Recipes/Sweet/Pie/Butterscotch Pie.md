## Ingredients

- Butter, unsalted, 1 Tbsp.
- Milk, whole, 3 cups
- Heavy Cream, 1/4 cup
- Egg Yolk, beaten, 6
- Salt, 1 tsp.
- Cornstarch, 1/3 cup
- Sugar, granulated, 3/4 cup
- Brown Sugar, 1/2 cup packed
- Water, 1/4 cup
## Instructions

1. Whisk egg yolks in their own bowl and set aside.
2. In a small pot, add water and granulated sugar. Stir slowly and gently with a silicone spatula over medium heat until sugar is completely dissolved.
3. Increase the heat to medium-high and continue to cook the sugar, swirling the pan but NOT STIRRING. Do this until the mixture is a dark amber. Be VERY careful not to burn this.
4. Remove from heat and slowly stir in the heavy cream before setting aside. Congratulations! You just made butterscotch!
5. In another small pot, mix the brown sugar, cornstarch, and salt. Add half of the milk, whisking to combine. Whisk in the rest of the milk. Set over medium high heat, whisking often, until it comes to a boil. Remove from heat and add in the butterscotch mixture.
6. Gradually ladle about 1/4 of the butterscotch liquid into the bowl of egg yolks, whisking constantly. Once mixed, repeat once before adding the eggs back into the butterscotch liquid, continue whisking constantly, bring back to a boil over medium high heat. Boil for 2-3 minutes, or until it is thick like pudding.
7. Remove from heat and stir in the butter. Whisk vigorously to help the cooling process. Strain through a metal sieve if you have one (to remove any lumps). Pour it into a prepared pie crust, such as a [[Crumb Pie Crust]] made with Biscoff cookies.
