## Ingredients

- Cookies, 1 cup*
- Butter, unsalted, 6 Tbsp.
- Any aromatic spices for your crust (cinnamon, for example, for a graham cracker crust for cookie apple pie)

NOTE: This can be any dry, crumb-making cookie, as long as it is 9 oz, about 1 cup. 
- Biscoff cookies
- Oreos (cream removed)
- Graham crackers
- Nutter butter (cream removed)
- Nilla Wafers
## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350.
2. If you do not have a food processor, use a large ziploc bag to turn your cookies into a fine crumb (beat it or squish it).
3. Melt the butter, and mix it into the bag/ food processor and mix until incorporated.
4. Form it to the shape of a 9 inch pie tin, using the bottom of a cup or something flat. Make sure it is evenly distributed, get rid of any lumps by pressing it and smoothing it, etc.
5. Bake until it is fragrant, about 10-13 minutes. Let it cool completely before using for pie.
